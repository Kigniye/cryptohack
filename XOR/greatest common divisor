The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.
Euclid's algorithm repeatedly divides the numbers:
Replace the larger number with the remainder of the division.
Continue until the remainder is zero.
The last non-zero number is the GCD.



def gcd(a, b):
    while b:  # Keep going until b is zero
        a, b = b, a % b  # Update a with b, and b with the remainder
    return a  # Return the last non-zero number as the GCD

# Example usage:
gcd_result = gcd(66528, 52920)
print(gcd_result)
