The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) is the largest number that divides exactly two integers aa and bb.

    For example, for a=12a=12 and b=8b=8, the GCD is 4, because 4 is the largest common divisor.
    If two numbers are coprime (meaning their only common divisor is 1), their GCD is 1.
    The GCD can be calculated using Euclid's algorithm, which uses successive divisions.

Uses:

    Simplifying fractions: Divide the numerator and denominator by their GCD.
    Cryptography and number theory: The GCD is important in many mathematical and security applications.

In summary, the GCD of two numbers is the largest common divisor of those numbers.


def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Example usage:
gcd_result = gcd(66528, 52920)
print(gcd_result)
