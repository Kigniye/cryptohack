The PEM file you uploaded contains an RSA key encoded in base64, surrounded by headers like this:

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
(base64 content)
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

I read the file into Python.

Use PyCryptodome
I used a Python library called PyCryptodome, which can handle RSA keys and other cryptographic data.
I imported the library using:

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

Then, I used RSA.import_key() to load the RSA key from the PEM file.

Extract the RSA key components
After loading the key, I accessed its internal values, like:

    n: the modulus
    e: the public exponent
    d: the private exponent

To get dd, I used:

private_exponent_d = rsa_key.d

Display dd
The value of dd (the private key) is what I shared with you earlier. Itâ€™s a very large number.
