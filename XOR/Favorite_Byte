The challenge involves discovering a hidden "flag" in a hexadecimal-encoded string. This string is likely encrypted using an XOR cipher with an unknown key. The goal is to find the key (a number between 0 and 255) that decrypts the message, which is expected to start with the word "crypto," a common feature in cryptographic challenges.

Code Breakdown
Convert Hex to Bytes: The hexadecimal string is converted into a list of byte values using bytes.fromhex(). This allows working with the binary data that was encrypted.

string_ord = [o for o in bytes.fromhex(string)]
Loop Through Possible Keys (0-255): The code loops over all possible key values (from 0 to 255), assuming that one of these keys was used for encryption.

for order in range(256):
Apply XOR: For each key, the XOR operation is applied between the key and each byte of the encrypted string, attempting to reverse the encryption.

possible_flag_ord = [order ^ o for o in string_ord]
Check for Valid Message: The code reconstructs the message by converting the decrypted bytes back into ASCII characters. It checks if the resulting message starts with "crypto," indicating that the correct key has been found.

possible_flag = "".join(chr(o) for o in possible_flag_ord)
if possible_flag.startswith("crypto"):
    flag = possible_flag
    break
Display the Flag: Once the correct key is found and the message starts with "crypto," the flag is displayed.

print("Flag:")
print(flag)
Expectations and Solution Process
The goal is to find the correct XOR key that decrypts the string, revealing a message starting with "crypto." The program tests all keys from 0 to 255. When it finds a valid message starting with "crypto," it stops and prints the flag.

The string is encrypted using XOR with an unknown key.
The program applies XOR with all possible keys (0-255) to each byte of the string.
When the decrypted message starts with "crypto," the search ends, and the flag is displayed.


# Solution

string = "73626960647f6b206821204f21254f7d694f7624662065622127234f726927756d"

string_ord = [o for o in bytes.fromhex(string)]
for order in range(256):
    possible_flag_ord = [order ^ o for o in string_ord]
    possible_flag = "".join(chr(o) for o in possible_flag_ord)
    if possible_flag.startswith("crypto"):
        flag = possible_flag
        break

print("Flag:")
print(flag)
