In modular arithmetic, when we talk about finding the square root modulo an integer pp, we're essentially trying to find an integer aa such that a2≡xmod  pa2≡xmodp for some integer xx. However, not every integer has a square root in modular arithmetic.
Steps to solve the problem:

    Quadratic Residue:
        A number xx is called a quadratic residue modulo pp if there exists an integer aa such that a2≡xmod  pa2≡xmodp. If no such aa exists, xx is a quadratic non-residue.

    Square Root Modulo pp:
        We need to find a solution to the equation a2≡xmod  pa2≡xmodp for x∈{14,6,11}x∈{14,6,11} where p=29p=29. We also know that if xx is a quadratic residue, it will have exactly two square roots, aa and −a−a, modulo pp.

    Method:
        To find whether xx has a square root, we check each integer aa from 1 to p−1p−1 and compute a2mod  pa2modp. If a2≡xmod  pa2≡xmodp, then aa is a square root of xx modulo pp.

    Quadratic Residue and Non-Residue:
        In the given case, we need to check for each number in the list ints=[14,6,11]ints=[14,6,11] whether it is a quadratic residue modulo 29. If it is, find the square root.

for n in ints:

    for a in range(1, p):
        # Check if a^2 mod p equals n
        if pow(a, 2, p) == n:
            # If the condition is satisfied, update x with the smallest value between x and a
            x = min(x, a)

# Print the smallest value of a found for one of the n in ints
print(x)
