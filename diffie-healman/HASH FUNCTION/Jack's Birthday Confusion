Jackâ€™s Birthday Confusion

Similarly to the previous problem, n=211n=211.
Let pp represent the probability that at least two secrets share the same hash in a given kk secrets. Then !p(k)!p(k) (the complement) represents the probability that all kk secrets have distinct hashes.

The script calculates the smallest kk such that p>0.75p>0.75:
*************************************************************************************************
from math import factorial
n = 2048
for i in range(n):
    probability = 1 - factorial(n) / (factorial(n - i) * pow(n, i))
    if probability > 0.75:
        print(i)
        break
