The code tries to find the smallest generator (or primitive element) of a finite field Fp∗Fp∗​, where p=28151p=28151.

    Generator Concept: A generator is an element in a group that can generate all other elements of the group through its powers. For the finite field Fp∗Fp∗​, a generator kk means that knkn (mod pp) for different values of nn gives all the non-zero elements in the group.

    The function is_generator(k, p):
        This function checks if k is a generator for Fp∗Fp∗​.
        It checks all powers of k from n=2n=2 to p−1p−1.
        If for any nn, knmod  p=kknmodp=k, it means that kk repeats too early and is not a generator.
        If no repetition occurs, k is a generator.

    The loop over k:
        The outer loop goes through all numbers kk from 0 to p−1p−1.
        It checks each kk using is_generator(k, p).
        When it finds the first generator, it prints it and stops the loop.
